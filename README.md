## Inspiration
Managing a more than full courseload hasn't been easy. One thing that always bothered me was constantly switching to my calendar tab just to see what I had left to do for the day. We wanted to find a nice solution that follows wherever you go when you're browsing the web!
## What it does
With Productivity Pal, you can effortlessly organize your tasks, set optional deadlines, and receive timely reminders to keep you on track. But that's not all – we understand the importance of staying hydrated during those long work sessions, so we've included friendly water reminders to ensure you're feeling your best throughout the day.

But here's where it gets really fun – Productivity Pal gamifies your task completion experience! Earn vibrant color rewards upon completing tasks, adding a splash of excitement to your productivity journey. And when deadlines are in play, watch your progress bar fill up as you inch closer to meeting your goals.
## How we built it
We used a JavaScript, CSS, JSON, and HTML tech stack, using the Google Extension, Notification, and Alarm API.
## Challenges we ran into
When we started this hackathon, we spent most of the first day trying to implement Google Calendar API to quickly peek at your calendar but we not so quickly realized that Google is not ok with that. We had never worked with extensions before, but through that challenge, we also learned that most documentation was outdated due to the most recent Manifest version released by Google that stopped supporting an insane amount of functions. 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are so proud that we were able to make an extension from scratch with close to zero JS, HTML, and CSS knowledge. We weren't sure if we were going to be able to get past the documentation hurdle, but luckily we were able to push through, pivot, and make something pretty awesome and super useful for students and professionals everywhere.
## What we learned
We learned basically our entire tech stack from scratch, how extensions work, how Google manages its APIs, and what persistence and a successful pivot look like! 
## What's next for Productivity Pal
In the future, we want to implement custom notifications, such as yoga poses, sunlight reminders, and good times for a break. We think AI could be incredibly useful for personalized notifications, catering to every user. We also would like to support cross-platform and cloud capabilities.
